**NOTE**:

* On Windows with **chocolatey** (https://chocolatey.org/), do as an administrator:

```powershell
choco install -y nodejs-lts
```

* On Mac OSX with **Homebrew** (https://brew.sh/), do:

* Follow the rest of the setup below

## The Dashboard

#### Configuration

There is one template provided: **src/assets/config-template.json**.

Rename it to **config.json**.

Move this configuration file into the **src/assets** directory.

Edit this file, you will set relevant config data in it.

#### Connect to the Central Service REST Server (CSRS)

The dashboard is served by a web server, downloaded into the browser and will call the REST Server to retrieve and display the data.

Set the REST Server URL:

```json
  "CentralSystemServer": {
    "protocol": "http",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 80
  },
```

### Create and set a Google Maps API key
Ev-dashboard requires you to setup a Google API key: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#restrict_key.
Once the key is created it must be enabled (from the Google Console) and the value must replace the one present in /src/index.html, in Google Maps section:

	src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=<YOUR_KEY_HERE>&libraries=places&language=en"></script>

### Setup the reCaptcha API key
In order to call REST endpoints of ev-server, a reCaptcha key is required. Refers to this link https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create to create one then copy the client key in config.json, in User section:

```json 
	"User": {
	  "maxPictureKb": 150,
	  "captchaSiteKey": "<GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_KEY_CLIENT>"
	},
```

## Start the Dashboard Server

### Development Mode

```shell
npm start
```

### Production Mode

First build the sources with:
```shell
npm run build:prod
```

Next, start the server with:
```shell
npm run start:prod
```

### Secured Production Mode (SSL)

Build the sources as above and run it with:
```shell
npm run start:prod:ssl
```

## Tests End To End

To run e2e tests, you first need to have a server and UI up and running. Then start the e2e suite with:
```shell
npm run e2e
```

That's it!
